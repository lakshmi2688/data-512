    "<h3> Motivation </h3> \n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The goal of this project is to explore the COVID-19 data and its overall impact on people’s behavior, mental health, and livelihoods. There is a large amount of emotionally negative stimuli related to the COVID-19 pandemic. How do people prepare themselves in difficult times like this? Understanding the impact on people is important in order to mitigate the effects and be more prepared in the future. Analyzing and exploring people's response to pandemic can provide useful insights into perspective about COVID and how prepared are the people. Does the pandemic affect minority groups more than others?  How do different groups based on age, race and ethnicity differ in their behavior or attitude towards COVID? It will also be useful to explore patterns in people's response based on certain factors. Is there any change in people's attitude from week 1 of phase 1 to the last week in phase 2?</p>\n",
